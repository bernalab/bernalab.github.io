NOTES FOR LINDSAY:

    - make github account
    - create a repo with <<username>>.github.io
    - go to <<username>>.dev.github.io to help make a file
        - if she wants to do it on vs code teach her how

    - you can download git according to the slides, then link your computer folder to the repo


STEPS FOR GIT:

    CONFIGURING YOUR ACCOUNT
        - git config --global user.email <<email>>
        - git config --global user.name <<username>>

    STARTING A PROJECT
        - GIT INIT: INITIALIZES GIT INTO YOUR FOLDER TO GET IT WORKING

    STUFF YOU CAN DO IN GIT (kinda in order on how used)

        - CLONE: TAKES ALL THE CODE FROM A REPO TO PUTS IT ON YOUR LOCAL FOLDER
        - ADD: ADDS THE FILES INTO A COLLECTION (THE COMMIT) THROUGH UPDATES 
        - COMMIT: COLLECTING THE DATA IN ORDER TO LATER "PUSH" INTO THE MAIN CODE
        - PUSH: SENDS THE CODE TO THE CLOUD AND CHANGES WHAT THE REPO ACTUALLY HOLDS
            - EVERYTHING IS ON YOUR COMPUTER LOCALLY UNTIL PUSH IS DONE

        ADDITIONAL BRANDON NOTE:

            - BRANCH: PRACTICALLY CREATES A NEW FOLDER SO YOU CAN SEPARATE CODE
                - HELPS ORGANIZE PEOPLE WORKING ON THE SAME PROJECT
